    <h1>libyear</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>simple</strong> measure of <em>software dependency
      freshness</em>. It is a <strong>single number</strong> telling you how
      up-to-date your dependencies are.

    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p>
      For example, a rails 5.0.0 dependency (released June 30, 2016) is roughly
      <em>1 libyear</em> behind the 5.1.2 version (released June 26,
      2017).
    </p>
    <h2>Simpler is Better</h2>
    <p>
      There are obviously more nuanced ways to calculate dependency freshness.
      The advantage of this approach is its simplicity. You will be able to
      explain this calculation to your colleagues in about 30s.
    </p>
    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <p>
      If your system has two dependencies, the first <em>one</em> year old, the
      second <em>three</em>, then your system is <em>four</em> libyears
      out-of-date.
    </p>
    <h2>A Healthy App</h2>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.singlebrook.com">Singlebrook</a> we try to keep
      our client’s apps below 10 libyears. We regularly rescue projects that are
      over 100 libyears behind.
    </p>
    <h2>Other Measurements</h2>
    <p>
      <code>libyear-bundler</code> implements some of the other metrics
      described by (Bouwers, Eekelen, Visser, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>--versions</code> flag provides a metric for an installed
      dependency’s freshness relative to the newest release’s major, minor, and
      patch versions. Of course, this is most useful for dependencies that
      follow a consistent versioning scheme such as semver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>--releases</code> flag provides a metric for the number of
      releases between an installed version of dependency and the newest
      released version of the dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each metric has it’s own advantages and disadvantages, and all quantify
      the maintenance burden for an app. Taken together, they can help
      prioritize maintenance for an inherited app, or help maintain a baseline
      level of dependency freshness for an ongoing project.
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      "lib" is short for "library", the most common form of dependency.
