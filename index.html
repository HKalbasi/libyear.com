    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>
      If your system has two dependencies, the first <em>one</em> year old, the
      second <em>three</em>, then your system is <em>four</em> libyears
      out-of-date.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are obviously more nuanced ways to calculate dependency freshness.
      The advantage of this approach is its simplicity. You will be able to
      explain this calculation to your colleagues in about 30s.
